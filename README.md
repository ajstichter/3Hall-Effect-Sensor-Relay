# 3Hall-Effect-Sensor-Relay

Raspberry Pi runs the puzzle.
Version: a01041; 2 Model B; Q1 2015
Running Raspbian version: 9 (stretch)

To Do:
3/9/2018
Using the basics of the hall_sensor_basic_test.py for the proof of concept (that the hall effect sensors act as a switch) build a GUI which incorporates the intentions of the picture GUI_example-hall-effect.jpg

When all 3 hall effect sensors trigger (fyi the hall effect sensors have an indicator light on them individually so no need to incorporate a LED light in the program) then the Relay is triggered. 

Sam, Use 3hall_effect_relay.py or add in your own file to actually use the GUI.
